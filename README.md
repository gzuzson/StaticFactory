# StaticFactory

StaticFactory is a text-based video game application built in Java where users 
play as a stranded Astronaut.  The user's goal is to survive whilst collecting 
scraps to fix his spaceship.  This application was built as part of an 
assignment aimed at teaching students the importance of object-oriented design
and implementation.  As part of the development process, I was responsible 
for extending a codebase by implementing desired extensions of the game, making 
sure that my extensions were implemented using a solution which complied with 
SOLID principles.  For this assignment, I topped a cohort of 600+ students, 
achieving the highest grade.  An in-depth analysis of this game implementation 
can be found in the docs/design/assignment1 directory.
